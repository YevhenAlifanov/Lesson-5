Add new tests (mocha) to the project from lesson 6:
Go to https://www.bmwusa.com/.
Click on any car using css selectors to find an element.
Extract a price of any middle car model using xPath as a locator.
Convert price to numeric and compare with the expected price in the test using chai for asserting.
